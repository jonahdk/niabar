    <h1>Welcome to the website for the Government of the Republic of Niabar!</h1>
    <p>
      The Republic of Niabar (or just Niabar) was founded on January 25th, 2022, at roughly 10:00 PM Eastern Time. We originally declared independence from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, within the United States of America. By declaring independence, we did not (and still do not) mean any violence towards the USA, and we would hope to still be good friends with them, or indifferent if not. Both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution will be posted on our "Important Documents" page soon, with all current (excluding repealed) bills. The contact email for the Government of Niabar is niabar@mvmc.xyz.
